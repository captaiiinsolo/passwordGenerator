## Description

[Visit the Deployed site here!](https://captaiiinsolo.github.io/passwordGenerator/)

In this project, I was asked to create a password generator that would create a new password based on user input. Users can generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long, and can include all or one of the following criteria: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters. If the user wants a password that is under the 8 character minimum, or the 128 character maximum, they will be alerted to try again. Similarly, if a user denies all character criteria options, they will be alerted to try again.

## Usage

Upon reaching the site users must select the generate password button in order to activate the generator. From there they will be asked a series of criteria questions regarding the password they would like to generate. Once all questions have been answered the user will either have a newly generated password in the text box or they will be prompted to try again if the criteria was not met.
